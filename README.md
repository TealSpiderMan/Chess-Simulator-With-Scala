# ChessBoard - ScalaFX Chessboard

This project implements a graphical chessboard using **ScalaFX**. It provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) displaying an 8x8 chessboard with alternating light and dark squares. The chessboard is rendered using ScalaFX's Canvas and drawing functionalities.

## Features

- Renders an 8x8 chessboard with alternating square colors (light and dark).
- Uses **ScalaFX** to create a GUI with basic drawing capabilities.
- Each square's color alternates based on its position (like a real chessboard).

## Requirements

- **Scala** 2.12.x or higher
- **ScalaFX** 8.x (version compatible with Scala 2.12.x)
